## 📌 Project Overview  
🚀 **Can historical business features accurately predict future revenue?**  

This project builds a **supervised machine learning pipeline** to forecast business revenue based on a variety of features like **product cost, ad spend, market size, and operational scale**. Designed as a full-cycle analyst project, it includes **EDA, feature engineering, and regression modeling**.

---

### 🔍 **Key Business Insights**  
✅ **Advertising spend shows a strong positive correlation with revenue.**  
✅ **Product cost-to-price ratio is a significant determinant of revenue performance.**  
✅ **Companies with higher market presence have notably stable revenue growth.**  
✅ **Seasonal trends and regional differences subtly influence revenue.**

> **💡 Real-World Impact:** Enables businesses to **strategically budget**, optimize **pricing models**, and **forecast profits** more accurately.
